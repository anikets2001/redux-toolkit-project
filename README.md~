Q.What was the problem ?
Whenever we want to transfer the data from one components to another let's say from one grand-parent to grand child we have to pass it through many in between components 
this is called prop-drilling. The major problem with prop drilling is that we have to pass the data through many components which is not the ideal case for security reason

To solve this problem we have many approached :
1.contextApi 
2.redux
3.Redux-toolkit

Q. Terminologies in redux-toolkit
1.Store: It is the single source of truth, it contains all the states and data inside it.
2.reducer: This is the place where all the logics are written.
3.useSelector: reducers cannot directly communicate to the store for that reason useSelector hook is used as a mediator. It is used along with the reducers to update information in the store.


react-redux is used to wired the redux and react thing together.
